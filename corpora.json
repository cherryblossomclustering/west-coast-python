risk studies on painkillers, a\nsituation that he said made selecting the right drug a ``total\ncrapshoot.''", "In his view, the new Vioxx data quantified the risk and made it\nmanageable.", "``The curves show not even a hint of a detrimental effect\nfor 18 months,'' and even after that the risks did not appear that\nlarge.", "``I thought the risk was going to be larger than it was,'' he\nsaid.", "But Northwestern University rheumatologist Thomas Schnitzer argued\nfor ditching Vioxx entirely because Merck's scientists could not\nexplain why the drug started causing heart attacks after 18 months.", "Furthermore, Merck's carefully cultivated image would go out the\nwindow if Vioxx stayed on the market, he said, because Merck ``prides\nitself on its ethical approach.", "I couldn't see Merck saying we're\ngoing to market a drug with a safety problem.''", "At lunchtime on Monday, Sept. 27, it was time to make a final\ndecision.", "Kim, Frazier and Gilmartin gathered in

shown preliminary slides\nfrom the colon polyp study and were told by Merck that the drug would\nbe withdrawn.", "The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research director\nSteven Galson said there was discussion of keeping the drug for\nshort-term use, but the company did not think it was practical.", "Fearful of a leak, Merck officials waited until the next day,\nWednesday, to tell international

Vioxx,'' Gilmartin began.", "Since the Merck decision, public health advocates and some\ncongressional leaders have asked pointedly why the FDA, the nation's\narbiter of drug safety, did not act sooner itself.", "Galson said that\nhis agency met often with Merck to discuss earlier troubling Vioxx\nstudies, and said that ``we insisted that we needed more information\nabout the cardiovascular risks.''", "In 2001, the agency formally warned\nthe company against misleading doctors about those risks, and in 2002,\nthe FDA required stiffer wording on the drug label.", "Nonetheless, the agency had agreed with Merck that the 2000 study\nhad too many confounding aspects to be definitive.", "The national\nadverse event reporting system that helps the FDA flag dangerous side\neffects was of little use in this case because the ailments possibly\ncaused by Vioxx  heart attacks and strokes  are so common.", "Galson also said that Vioxx safety follow-up was complicated by the\nfact that it is unethical to give placebos to arthritic patients,\nbecause their pain needs treatment.", "Instead the FDA strongly supported\nthe Merck decision to use three placebo-controlled trials in healthy\npeople to test whether the drug was protective against prostate and\ncolon cancer and colon polyps and also to study cardiovascular risk.", "The FDA's own study of the Vioxx safety issue has become mired in\ncontroversy.", "The FDA safety officer in charge of the report, David\nGraham, concluded that Vioxx posed much greater cardiovascular risk\nthan the other major drug in its class, Celebrex.", "He presented that\ninformation at a French conference this summer.", "Galson has said,\nhowever, that he only saw a short abstract of the study and so could\nnot act on its conclusions, a

that an herbal product contains what the label says it\ndoes or that it is free from harmful contaminants.", "Independent\nanalyses of some products, particularly those containing costly or\nscarce herbs, revealed that some have little or none of the\npurported active ingredient listed on the label.", "Adding to the confusion is that botanical makers are allowed to\ndescribe products only in terms of their effects on the structure\nor function of the body, not their potential health benefits.", "Thus,\na product label might say ``promotes cardiac function'' but it\ncannot say ``lowers cholesterol.''", "Likewise, although the law does allow health warnings on the\nlabel, most manufacturers have yet to include them.", "Consumers are warned, however, that federal drug safety\nofficials are not watching the store.", "All botanicals must display a\ndisclaimer on the label following the description of the product's\nstructural or functional role: ``This statement has not been\nevaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.", "This product is not\nintended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.''", "To\nwhich Tyler commented, ``If that is true, why on

'90s with the growing consumer\ninterest in ``self-care and controlling one's destiny,'' he said.", "Many turned to herbs as a gentler way to treat health problems and\na potential tool for preserving mental and physical health.", "The interest has spawned scores of Internet sites and hundreds\nof books on various herbs.", "But much of the literature is replete\nwith poorly documented health claims and, with few exceptions\n(among them, Tyler's books), advocacy prevails over objectivity.", "Because plants contain a mixture of relatively diluted\nchemicals, they naturally tend to have milder actions, both in\ntheir therapeutic benefits and side effects, than the concentrated,\nsingle chemicals in most drugs.", "Thus, botanicals generally take\nlonger to act than regular pharmaceuticals and few have the potency\nof a prescription, the one possible exception being saw palmetto,\nwhich a well-designed study indicated may be as helpful for an\nenlarged prostate as the more expensive and riskier drug, Proscar.", "The combination of chemicals in botanicals is potentially both a\nplus and a minus.", "When two or more chemicals enhance one another's\nactivity, the therapeutic benefit could theoretically exceed that\nof an isolated substance formulated as a drug.", "Mark Blumenthal, who\nheads the American Botanical Council, noted that the herb St.\nJohn's wort, widely used in Germany and increasingly in the United\nStates to counter mild depression, is standardized for a substance\ncalled hypericin.", "But, he explained, ``hypericin is not directly\nlinked to its antidepressant activity.''", "Rather, other substances\nin the herb seem to have diverse actions on brain chemicals, all of\nwhich work together to counter depression.", "Equally possible, though, when using an herb with two or more\nactive chemicals, is that one will cancel the benefits of another\nor introduce a hazard.", "Without careful chemical tests and large,\nwell-controlled clinical trials such actions are often hard to\ndetect.", "Consumer confidence in herbal medicine is bolstered by the\ncommon but erroneous assumption that ``natural'' equals ``safe''\nand the public's failure to realize that many plants contain\nchemicals that are potent drugs or outright poisons.", "Natural\nlaxatives like the herb Cascara sagrada are just as habit-forming\nand harmful to the colon as laxatives sold as drugs.", "nn\n\n\n   Indeed, one quarter of prescription drugs and hundreds of\nover-the-counter products were originally isolated from plants.", "Ephedra, for example, contains a natural stimulant that is approved\nfor use as a decongestant and bronchial dilator in some\npharmaceutical products.", "However, when used in uncontrolled dosages\nor by people with certain underlying health problems, it can cause\na dangerous rise in blood pressure and, in its herbal form, has\nbeen responsible for serious adverse reactions and dozens of\ndeaths, mainly among people who inappropriately used it as a\nstimulant or diet aid.", "Complicating the safety issue is the fact, shown in several\nrecent surveys, that most patients fail to tell their physicians\nthey use herbal supplements and thus sometimes risk dangerous drug\ninteractions or endure costly tests or treatments when an herb\ncauses an unrecognized side effect.", "Experts say many patients\nwithhold information about herbal drug use because they fear being\nridiculed by their doctors.", "Although all German physicians must take courses on herbal\nremedies, only a handful of American medical and pharmacology\nschools offer courses in this field.", "A year ago, the President's Commission on Dietary Supplement\nLabels recommended that the FDA appoint a committee to evaluate the\nsafety and effectiveness of herbal products.", "``This could be the\nmost important step in the United States toward legitimizing herbal\nmedicine,'' Tyler said.", "However, the agency responded that it lacked the budget to\nsupport such an effort.", "American physicians have completed and\npublished only a few well-designed studies of some popular\nbotanicals.", "Among them were studies showing that saw palmetto can\nshrink an enlarged prostate and ginkgo biloba can improve memory in\npatients with early Alzheimer's disease.", "The Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of\nHealth is helping to finance a three-year multicenter study of St.\nJohn's wort as a treatment for clinical depression and a study of\nplant-based estrogens as a preventive for postmenopausal health\nproblems.", "However, thousands of studies of botanicals have been completed\nabroad _ mainly in Germany _ that strongly suggest a\nhealth-promoting role for more than 200 plant products.", "Germany's\nCommission E evaluated 380 botanicals, approving 254 as safe and\nreasonably effective and disapproving 126 as ineffective, unsafe or\nboth.", "The Germans use a different criterion to assess an herb's\nbenefits _ a doctrine of ``reasonable certainty'' that the herb has\nthe desired effect and is safe, Blumenthal said.", "Whereas standard\ntesting of a drug for approval by the FDA can cost as much as $500\nmillion per product _ a prohibitive amount for companies to spend\non botanicals that cannot be patented _ tests to establish\n``reasonable certainty'' would cost only $1 million to $2 million,\nTyler estimated.", "In June 1996, Dr. Robert Temple, director of medical policy for\nthe FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation, suggested that, rather than\nsubjecting botanicals to the extensive tests required for drugs,\nthe agency might consider applying less stringent criteria to\nassess an herb's effects, at least when a product is to be used\nonly for a short time.", "He said, ``A long history of safe use might\nprovide sufficient safety information for products that are\nintended for short-term use.''", "More than four dozen botanicals or botanical formulations have\nbeen submitted to the agency as investigational new drugs.", "If any\nmeet the agency's criteria for safety and effectiveness and are\neventually approved as drugs, they would be allowed to carry direct\nhealth claims _ instead of just structure and function statements _\non labels and in advertising.", "Meanwhile, Dr. Joerg Gruenwald, medical director of a German\nphytomedicine company and primary editor of the new Physicians'\nDesk Reference for Herbal Medicines, said professionals can rely on\nthat volume for current, documented information about botanicals.", "The volume, to be
