The four officers, who are scheduled to be arraigned on criminal charges in state Supreme Court in the Bronx on Wednesday, did not testify about the shooting before the grand jury that heard their case.
Those officers told associates that they grew more suspicious when two of them got out of their car to question him and he retreated into the vestibule of the building, the people knowledgeable about the case said on Tuesday.
A judge ordered four police officers Wednesday to stand trial for the fatal shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant.
