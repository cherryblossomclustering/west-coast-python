Exercise alone was enough to prevent the degeneration of brain cells in rats with Parkinson's disease, University of Pittsburgh researchers report.
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- An international research team, led by scientists at the National Institute on Aging (NIA), has discovered a gene which, when mutated, causes Parkinson's disease in some families.
Like many degenerative brain diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, proteins targeted in the disease process begin misfolding and clumping in or around brain cells, which are called neurons.
