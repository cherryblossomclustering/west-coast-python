For five days Merck had been struggling with what to do with frightening new data that showed that long-term use of their $2.5 billion arthritis drug Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes, confirming concerns raised by earlier studies.
When Merck voluntarily withdrew Vioxx, FDA officials said heart problems were unique to that drug and that the mechanism underlying them wasn't known.
Merck officials said last week its latest research showed an increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications in patients who took Vioxx for at least 18 months.
