There were cheers and grins here, eight days after teen-age gunmen walked the halls of their school and killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves.
Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs.
Students leaving the school said the intense security inside scared them.
Students returned to classes Thursday at Chatfield High School, but the bloodbath at rival Columbine High haunted the halls.
