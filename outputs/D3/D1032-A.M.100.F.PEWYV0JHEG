Statoil, which will need a green light from the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority before resuming production, shut down Snorre A on November 28 last year after a gas leak was detected.
Production was suspended and 180 of 216 employees were evacuated after a gas leak appeared at the Snorre A platform in the North Sea on Sunday, giving rise to fears of an explosion.
Norway's daily oil production was down by an estimated 4 percent after a gas leak forced Statoil ASA to shut down one of its platforms in the North Sea.
