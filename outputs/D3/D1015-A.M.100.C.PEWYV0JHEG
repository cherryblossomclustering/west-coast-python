Xishuangbanna, one of China's largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
A tropical rain forest project is to start soon in south China's Hainan province.
Meanwhile Cui is also confident about the economic returns of the project, since the area boasts rich land resources and favorable soil and climate conditions for the growing of tropical rain trees.
In the 1950s, there were 2,000 black gibbons living in the forest area of the province's 10 counties.
