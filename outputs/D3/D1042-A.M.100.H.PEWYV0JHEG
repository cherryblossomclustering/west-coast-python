Lynndie R. England, the 22-year-old woman who became an infamous presence in the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse photographs, pleaded guilty on Monday to seven of the nine counts against her, under an agreement with military prosecutors.
Under a deal she made with military prosecutors, the reservist from Fort Ashby, W.Va., will serve less than the maximum term of 11 years in prison that could result from her guilty plea.
The military judge, Colonel James Pohl, halted proceedings after England indicated that she did not believe her actions were wrong.
