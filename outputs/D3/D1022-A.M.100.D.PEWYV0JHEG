Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court to sue Japanese whaling company Kyodo Senpaku for allegedly killing around 400 minke whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary.
Earlier this week Prime Minister John Howard personally wrote to his Japanese counterpart, Junichiro Koizumi, urging him to scrap the plan to increase Japan's whale kill.
An animal rights group on Friday lost a bid to sue a Japanese whaling company for allegedly killing hundreds of whales inside an Australian whale sanctuary.
