Too little is known about 1,300 of the species to determine their status, but scientists believe that most of them are in peril, too.
The report evaluated the status of all known species of amphibians -- 5,743 of them -- and concluded that 1,856, or 32 percent, were critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable to extinction.
Almost 150 species of amphibians have apparently gone extinct and at least one-third of the rest are facing imminent threats that could soon wipe them out, according to a worldwide assessment by scientists published Thursday.
