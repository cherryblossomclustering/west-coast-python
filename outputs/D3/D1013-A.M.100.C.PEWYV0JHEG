Prosecutors said Frank was the victim of the fastest-growing crime in America: identity theft.
Most identity fraud starts small, with a few forged checks or purchases on a stolen credit card.
Identity theft accounts for about half of the $1.5 billion in credit card theft in 1995, according to the Secret Service, which monitors the crime.
She had no idea what identity theft was until 1995, when she received a call from the Bank of New York demanding that Frank pay up on her $11,000 credit card balance.
