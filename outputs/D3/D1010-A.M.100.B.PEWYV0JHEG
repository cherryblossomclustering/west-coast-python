Medical tests on a young Irishman have confirmed that he is suffering from variant CJD, the human form of mad cow disease, a Dublin hospital spokesman said on Wednesday.
Ireland may have suffered its first homegrown case of the human form of mad cow disease after a man in his early 20s was hospitalized in Dublin for suspected variant Crutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
Emory University Hospital has confirmed that a brain surgery patient does not have the human version of mad cow disease, but does have a rare, fatal disorder that resembles it.
