The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate alleged corruption by Soeharto as well as his wealth.
Since stepping down on May 21, the former president has faced mounting pressure for an investigation into alleged abuses of power and illicit accumulation of wealth by Soeharto, his family and cronies during his 32 years in office.
Indonesian Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said here Monday that an investigation on the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family, was going on.
