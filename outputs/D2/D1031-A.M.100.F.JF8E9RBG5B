A U.N. agriculture agency called Wednesday for the rehabilitation of mangroves damaged by the Asian tsunami, saying the move would help speed up recovery in areas affected by the devastating tidal waves.
The Indonesian Volcanic and Geological Disaster Mitigation Directorate (DVMBG) said on Friday 28 areas in the country are prone to tsunami tidal waves and called on local administrations and people to stay alert for such natural disasters.
Damage from the Indian Ocean tsunami could have been significantly reduced if more coastal areas had maintained their protective shields of mangrove swamps and coral reefs, conservation groups said Thursday.
