A new robotic microscope that follows a brain cell in the lab from a normal state to its death has led researchers to a surprising finding that appears to debunk a long-standing theory about Huntington's disease.
Exercise alone was enough to prevent the degeneration of brain cells in rats with Parkinson's disease, University of Pittsburgh researchers report.
He decided to build a microscope that would allow scientists to follow brain cells over a long period, akin to videotaping a neuron's life.
It has long been thought that the sticky protein triggers the death of brain cells.
