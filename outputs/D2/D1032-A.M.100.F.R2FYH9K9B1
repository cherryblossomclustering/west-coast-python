Norway's daily oil production was down by an estimated 4 percent after a gas leak forced Statoil ASA to shut down one of its platforms in the North Sea.
Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore petroleum platform later this week, almost a month after a natural gas leak shut down operations.
A Nov. 28 natural gas leak forced the shutdown of the Snorre A steel tension-leg platform and the evacuation of 180 workers.
"At the moment it is unclear when production from Snorre A and Vigdis will resume," Statoil said in a statement.
