Australia's prime minister on Wednesday criticized a move by Japan to increase its whale harvest in the Antarctic as a "very bad decision," but stood by his policy of not intercepting Japanese whaling boats.
Green Party lawmakers in Australia and New Zealand are considering urging consumers to boycott Japanese products to protest Tokyo's plan to expand its annual whale hunt, the party's co-leader said Monday.
Animal advocates hoping to halt a Japanese whale hunt announced plans Tuesday to appeal a legal decision that bars the group from filing a lawsuit against the whaling company Kyodo Senpaku.
