The kidnapping might be tied to Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of militants jailed in the United States, although some authorities said the Abu Sayyaf rebels were just trying to attract attention.
Muslim rebels in the Philippines who are seeking the release of militants jailed in the World Trade Center bombing case claimed responsibility Tuesday for the Malaysian kidnapping.
Philippine officials, however, expressed skepticism over the claim by the extremist Abu Sayyaf rebels.
Officials were searching today for the hostages -- half of whom are foreign tourists.
