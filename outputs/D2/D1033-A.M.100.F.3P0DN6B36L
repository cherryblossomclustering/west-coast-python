President Roh Moo-hyun on Tuesday said he will accept the resignation of South Korea's ambassador to the United States, who is stepping down over a burgeoning scandal surrounding the East Asian country's 1997 presidential election.
South Korea's spy agency apologized Friday for illegally recording phone conversations involving influential figures and admitted that wiretapping continued long after former President Kim Dae-jung ordered an end to it in 1998.
Ambassador Hong Seok-hyun called the presidential chief of staff, Kim Woo-sik, late Monday to say that he would resign.
