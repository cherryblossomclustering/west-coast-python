The Bush administration on Tuesday is to take the first step toward removing Yellowstone's grizzly bears, a living icon of the American West, from the nation's endangered species list.
Grizzly bears in areas surrounding Yellowstone National Park would be removed from the endangered species list under a proposal to be announced next week, officials said.
Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list later this year.
Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 grizzly bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
