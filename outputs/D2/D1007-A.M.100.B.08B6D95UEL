HONG KONG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is trying to persuade tourists that it is safe to come to the city because the bird flu is not so serious as to trigger an outbreak.
MACAO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The sales of chicken have dropped about 30 percent since bird flu killed children in Hong Kong this month, the Va Kio newspaper reported today.
The group will coordinate measures necessary for the prevention and control of the "bird flu," or H5N1 virus, the spokesman said.
Chickens have been identified as the most likely source of a new strain of the flu.
