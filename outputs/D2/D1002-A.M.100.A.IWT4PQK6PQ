NEW YORK (AP) -- Four white police officers were charged with murder Wednesday for killing an unarmed African immigrant in a hail of 41 bullets -- a shooting that has led to months of protests and a painful examination of police tactics and race relations.
The arraignment and the subsequent comments by the officers' lawyers offered a glimpse of the defense they will provide.
NEW YORK (AP) -- The cheering began as the parents of Amadou Diallo left the prosecutor's office.
Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy pleaded innocent in a Bronx courtroom to second-degree murder.
