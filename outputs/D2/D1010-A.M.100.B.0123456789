EU to spend e million (US$122 million) on mad cow testing next year The European Union head office said Friday it was allocating e million (US$122 million) on testing cattle across the 25-nation bloc to prevent the spread of mad cow disease next year.
Beef sold in Bulgaria since June 2004 has not been certified free of mad cow disease because the test used is not officially recognised by the European Union, mad-cow expert Roumen Valchovski said Friday.
The fatal brain-wasting disease is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease.
