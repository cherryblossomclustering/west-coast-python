Soil erosion is deteriorating in northwest China Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as excessive herding and farming have outpaced the government conservation efforts.
2005 the region has curbed soil erosion on more than 7,400 sq km of land.
Erosion made the land less fertile or turned the soil into sand and could affect agricultural production and lead to more frequent natural disasters such as drought.
China is managing to reverse soil erosion in many areas.
Hotter drier land is more vulnerable to soil erosion.
Desertification occurs when arable or habitable land is transformed into desert.
