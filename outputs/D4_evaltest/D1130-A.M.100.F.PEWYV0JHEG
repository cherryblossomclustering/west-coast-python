Indonesian navy ships battled storms and gale force winds to rescue 13 survivors of a ferry disaster with hundreds missing five days after the ship sank in a storm off Java island.
Search teams said 100 bodies had been recovered.
The ill-fated ferry was en route from Kumai on Borneo island to the Javanese port city of Semarang when it sank.
Rescue ships collected scores of bloated corpses from to where an Indonesian ferry sank in the Java Sea but search teams spotted survivors on life rafts and dropped food and water to them.
