A crane collapse on top of an office building sent pieces of granite steel and glass falling 44 stories.
Four construction workers were killed when a towering crane toppled onto a Manhattan apartment building in what Mayor Michael Bloomberg called one of the city worst construction accidents ever.
Buildings Department officials said construction on the building had been halted while the investigation continued.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at least four people believed to be construction workers have died and at least 10 people were injured in one of the city worst construction accidents in recent memory.
