NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd strengthened to a very dangerous Category 4 storm today with 155 mph wind, surprising forecasters and charging toward the Bahamas on a path that also threatened the Florida coast.
NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Storm-weary residents in the Bahamas braced for a brush with Hurricane Floyd as it swelled and powered up to a major storm, packing winds of up to 145 mph on Sunday.
The hurricane itself was likely to pass well north of the islands, meteorologists said.
By mid-afternoon, all of the Bahamas -- a 600-mile-long line of islands -- was under hurricane warnings or watches.
