The discovery of panda traces in Fengxian County, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, demonstrates that the habitat of the rare creatures is expanding in this inland province, an official with the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau said.
About 100 giant pandas in northwest China's Gansu Province are suffering from hunger because large tracts of arrow bamboo have bloomed and died.
Experts with the Shaanxi Provincial Wildlife Management Station confirmed that the dung was left by an adult giant panda.
"We have given priority to the afforestation in the habitats, especially nature reserves, for giant pandas," said Yang.
