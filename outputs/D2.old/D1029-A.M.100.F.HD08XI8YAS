A fierce gunbattle between paramilitary troops and renegade tribesmen left eight soldiers dead and 23 others wounded in an insurgency-wracked area of southwestern Pakistan, a troop spokesman said Friday.
Officials have said up to 45 people, including eight soldiers, were killed in the clashes between the Frontier Corps troops and Bugti tribesmen, who dominate Dera Bugti.
Helicopters were airlifting supplies to the troops to avoid traveling by road and confrontation with the tribesmen, Ghani told reporters in Quetta.
Intelligence sources on Thursday told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity that at least 16 tribesmen were killed in the fighting.
