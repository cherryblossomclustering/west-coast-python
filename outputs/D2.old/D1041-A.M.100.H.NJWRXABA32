Only about 30 percent of the world's coral reefs are healthy, down from 41 percent two years ago, according to a study released Monday that lists global warming as the top threat.
More than 58 percent of world coral reefs have been threatened by human pressure and weather change, said an press release issued on Saturday by a world conservation meeting held here.
Twenty percent of the world's coral reefs ``have been effectively destroyed and show no immediate prospect of recovery.''
The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed.
