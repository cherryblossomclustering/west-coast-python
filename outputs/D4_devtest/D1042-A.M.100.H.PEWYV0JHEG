Of the eight soldiers charged over the Abu Ghraib scandal Graner case has gone to trial.
The Abu Ghraib abuse scandal went public 2004 after photographs showing American soldiers mistreating and humiliating Iraqi prisoners surfaced.

Lynndie England guilty plea if approved would bring to eight the number of Army reservists convicted of abusing detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison.
