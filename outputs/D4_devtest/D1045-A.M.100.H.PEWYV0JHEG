A major chemical explosion at Jilin Petrochemical Company 380 kilometers up the Songhua river 13 had sent massive amounts of benzene into the waterway.
Two reservoirs on the Songhua River reinforced water discharge to dilute a massive slick of chemical pollutants floating through this capital of northeast China Heilongjiang.
The front of the polluted water of Songhua River in northeast China reached Harbin capital of Heilongjiang Province on early morning.
